Creating the Entity Class

Which we will pull from an already existing file..


If the parent directories aren't already in the project, 'mkdir -p' will create them for you. 

`mkdir -p /root/devonfw/workspaces/main/root/devonfw/workspaces/main/myapplication`{{execute T1}}

Switch to the editor and click 'Copy to Editor'. 

'ValidEntity.java' will be created automatically inside the newly created folder.

<pre class="file" data-filename="devonfw/workspaces/main/root/devonfw/workspaces/main/myapplication/ValidEntity.java">

</pre>
